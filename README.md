Title: SECURE  DATA  HIDING  IN  IMAGES USING  STEGANOGRAPHY

Abstract: In today's digital world, securing sensitive information is essential. This project focuses on using steganography to hide a secret message within an image using Python and OpenCV. 
The message is embedded into the least significant bits (LSB) of the image's pixels, making it invisible to the naked eye. 
A passcode is used to encrypt and decrypt the message, ensuring secure communication and preventing unauthorized access.

How it Works?
Programming Language: Python: The core programming language used to implement the steganography technique.
Libraries:OpenCV: For reading and writing image files and manipulating pixel data.
          OS: To interact with the operating system for tasks like opening the encrypted image file.
          String: For handling text data during encryption and decryption processes.
          
Platform: Windows
Development Environment: Any Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code) or terminal can be used for running and developing the project.

Concepts:
Steganography: The primary technique used to hide the message inside the image.
Encryption and Decryption: Used to secure and retrieve the hidden message based on the passcode provided.
